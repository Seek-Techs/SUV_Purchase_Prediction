This repository contains code for a project that explores predicting SUV purchases using Logistic Regression. The project utilizes the scikit-learn library and focuses on:

Data Loading and Cleaning: Loading data from a CSV file.
Feature Engineering: Selecting relevant features and potentially applying scaling.
Model Building: Training a Logistic Regression model.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like accuracy score.
The project serves as a foundational example for customer purchase prediction.
